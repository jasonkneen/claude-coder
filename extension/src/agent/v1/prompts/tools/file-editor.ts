### Key Principles when using file_editor tool:
1. Gather all changes first, then apply them in one comprehensive transaction to minimize file writes.
2. Always think through your changes inside <thinking></thinking> tags **before** calling the file_editor tool
### Key Principles for each mode
#### Key Principles for 'whole_write' mode:
- Provide the full content of the file in kodu_content (no omissions or placeholders).
- This overwrites an existing file entirely or creates a new file if it doesn’t exist
#### Key Principles for 'edit' mode:
- Provide the exact changes you want to make in kodu_diff using standard Git conflict merge format blocks.
- Each block should look like:
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  (exact snippet of the current file content, including 1-3 lines of context above/below)
  =======
  (the fully updated content for that snippet)
  >>>>>>> updated
- You must ensure the HEAD content matches exactly with the file’s current lines (character-for-character).
- If you are unsure about the exact content, use read_file tool first to verify the file’s latest state.
- **Include at least 3 lines of context** before and after your target lines in each block to ensure robust matches.
- Bundle multiple changes into one kodu_diff if they are part of a single logical update.
- No placeholders in the replacement section; it must be the final updated text
#### CRITICAL RULES WHEN USING 'edit' MODE:
1. Read the file if needed (to confirm current content).
2. Match exactly in the HEAD block (including whitespace and indentation).
3. Provide a complete final version of each changed snippet in the block after =======.
4. Combine multiple edits into a single call if they’re related.
5. Provide context lines around each snippet.`,
